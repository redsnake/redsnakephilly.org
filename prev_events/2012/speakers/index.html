      <p>
        Linear Regression is a simple, powerful, and widely-used technique for estimating the parameters of a function. It is often used to predict the value of an unknown variable based on one or more input variables and some historical data. There are a few different methods for solving linear regressions using least squares, and some very easy ways to do it in Python. We will talk about some of the history and theory behind linear regression, show how to implement it in Python, and discuss how it can be applied to real-world problems like predicting the percent alcohol of home-brewed beer.

        Every few years, Jason undertakes a rewrite of RedCloth &#8211; from regular expressions to state machines to packrats and PEGs &#8211; he&#8217;s tried them all in his quest to efficiently parse and transform Textile, one of the most complex formatting languages in existence.

      <p>
        Python and its broad standard library have frequently been used as the glue language in data transformation and analysis pipelines. There is an evolving set of modules and Python data types that help Python become a complete environment for many data analysis tasks, and Pandas looks like a promising key component to this growing area. From <a href="http://pandas.sourceforge.net">http://pandas.sourceforge.net</a>: &#8220;pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with relational or labeled data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.&#8221; Pandas is under development by Wes McKinney and several others. John will introduce the group to pandas and demo it as fast as he can.

      <p>
        Working within the startup field requires the ability to rapidly prototype, gain feedback, and quickly make changes that can completely alter one&#8217;s development timeline. This is especially true when working with technology-based startups, that require minimal viable products to prove their concept before making a large development investment. This talk examines the pros and cons of using Ruby (and the Rails framework), from the perspective of a newcomer to the language, with a focus on startup applications.

      <p>
        A continuation is an object that represents the control state of a process at a particular moment (instruction pointer and call stack). We can save this state and later restore it, to manipulate the flow of execution in unusual ways. We will start with a trivial example and build up to a technique for using a blocking API, concurrently, without threads.

        <em>Dustin works in enterprise cloud computing, and wrestles Java into submission on a daily basis. He is fascinated by decomposing ugly, complex abstractions into simple, elegant primitives, and thinks functional-oriented thinking helps make programming more like Legos.

        This talk asks two questions: &#8220;What is it like to use Python after using other tools and languages?&#8221; and &#8220;What is it like to use other tools and languages after using Python?&#8221; For a brief (and inevitably incomplete) answer, this talk turns to three topics as they apply in software: the process of learning, the ability to make friends through a text, and how one may wisely or unwisely go about solving technical problems.
