Our Call for Proposals is open! [Last year's
talks](http://trevmex.com/post/3198570101/redsnake-1st-annual-philly-ruby-python-meetup-notes)
were really fantastic, and we are expecting that the excellent developer
community here in the greater Philadelphia area can level-up to do themselves
one better. So put your thinking caps on and start sending proposals to
<info@redsnakephilly.org>.
