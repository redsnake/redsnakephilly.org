Hello again, everyone! Excitement is building for the coming RedSnake Philly meeting. If you didn't get a ticket, don't lose hope yet. We're hoping to squeeze a few more in so make sure to follow [@RedSnakePhilly](https://twitter.com/redsnakephilly) to get the word.

Or consider volunteering! We're looking for about 6 volunteers to help out. 3 will be handling Registration where job duties include:

* Letting in the pre-registered attendees first
* Giving out the T-Shirts and other swag
* Staving off the chaos as we try to pack 200 people into a space built for 60 :)

And 3 will be helping out with the food, including:

* Moving pizza from the kitchen to outside the rooms
* Keeping the beer stocked
* Cleaning up spent boxes and bottles

[Andrew Burnheimer](https://twitter.com/aburnheimer) has kindly volunteered to help coordinate the video stream, but if you're interested in things of the A/V nature, feel free to get in touch with him and help out there.

If you're interested in helping out with any of this please [email us](mailto:info@redsnakephilly.org) or hit us up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/redsnakephilly)!
