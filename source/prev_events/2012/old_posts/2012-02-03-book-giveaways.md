I'm happy to announce that in addition to the sweet shirts, beer and pizza being provided by our gracious [sponsors](/sponsors/) we'll also be featuring a variety of book giveaways!

Both [Manning Publications](http://www.manning.com/) and [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/) have chipped in a number of print books we'll be giving away at the event. O'Reilly will also be sending us a batch of free eBook codes for the attendees. And Manning has offered at 50% off deal on all print books.

For the Manning deal, just email your order to [Jason Stelzer](mailto:jason.stelzer@gmail.com). Monetate will take care of the order and you can pick up your books at the event. So, 50% off all books currently in print. No shipping fee. Pay for the books you ordered at redsnake. A big thanks to Manning and [Monetate](http://monetate.com) for making this happen!
