title: The Game of Hangman, Decision Theory and Delivering Software
author: Chris Conley
author_image: ChrisConley.png
abstract: Information entropy and utility functions. Bitmaps, makefiles and python generators. Who knew the seemingly simple game of hangman could be so much fun? And what does it all have to do with delivering software?<br/>During the talk, we'll solve the game starting with our naive childhood strategy then improve the strategy with some simple decision theory tricks. Along the way, we'll build a model for feedback, information gain and failure that we can apply directly to the way we deliver software.
bio: Chris Conley is a software engineer lead at Monetate. Prior to Monetate he co-founded an accelerator-backed startup, Houdini and a mobile train app, iSepta.org.
