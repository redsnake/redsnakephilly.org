title: Lapis - the Web Framework that Runs Inside Nginx
author: Stefan Natchev
abstract: Lapis is a small, yet feature-rich framework for Lua (and Moonscript!). Although obviously inspired by Rails, it stays true to Lua's philosophy of being small, simple to understand and composable. Because it relies on Nginx event loop, all actions including HTTP requests and database queries are asynchronous. With the power of Lua coroutines code is written synchronously but runs asynchronously, without all that callback spaghetti seen in other asynchronous platforms. It's fast, easy to read, and easy to write.
