title: Torquebox - Like a JBoss
author: Joe Winter
abstract: Torquebox is an application server that can run your Rails, Sinatra, or Rack-based app inside of JBoss. Torquebox gives you all of the caching, clustering, messaging, and background job management tools available from JBoss without having to leave the comfort of Ruby. This talk aims to give a basic overview of Torquebox's architecture, how to get it up and running, and some pros and cons on whether it might fit your application.
