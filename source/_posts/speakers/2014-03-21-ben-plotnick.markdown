author: Ben Plotnick
author_image: ben_plotnick.png
abstract: SaltStack is a powerful python-based configuration management and remote execution tool that allows you to easily control any environment - from two servers to thousands. Salt is scaleable, easy to use, and completely open source. I will walk through the main features of salt, how it compares to other tools, and why you will want to immediately start adding a little bit of salt to everything.
bio: Ben is a systems engineer at Susquehanna International Group - a global quantitative trading firm located in Bala Cynwyd, PA - working primarily on high performance computing and trading platform optimization.
