  <p>Our speaker list is almost complete! In addition to all these below, we&#8217;ve got talks about Salt Stack, what&#8217;s new in Python and Ruby, and Blinker.</p>

<div class="speaker">
  <div class="title">Brain-Controlled Robots with Python</div>
  
  <div class="pic" ><img alt="Alyssa Batula" src="/images/speakers/alyssa_300x300.jpeg"/></div>
  
  <div class="author">Alyssa Batula</div>
  <div class="abstract">How is Python (particularly Python 3) used to control the DARwIn-OP robot using brain signals? This talk will focus on two main features that allow this project to work. Multiprocessing keeps the four components of the program running in real time without worrying about the GIL, and Cython wraps the robot&#8217;s C++ code in a convenient Python package.</div>
  <div class="bio">Alyssa Batula is an electrical engineering Ph.D. candidate at Drexel University, working on a project to control a robot using recorded brain signals. She has taught Python through PhillyPUG and <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/philadelphia">Girl Develop It Philadelphia</a>.</div>

  <div class="title">The Game of Hangman, Decision Theory and Delivering Software</div>
  
  <div class="pic" ><img alt="Chris Conley" src="/images/speakers/ChrisConley.png"/></div>
  
  <div class="author">Chris Conley</div>
  <div class="abstract">Information entropy and utility functions. Bitmaps, makefiles and python generators. Who knew the seemingly simple game of hangman could be so much fun? And what does it all have to do with delivering software?<br/>During the talk, we&#8217;ll solve the game starting with our naive childhood strategy then improve the strategy with some simple decision theory tricks. Along the way, we&#8217;ll build a model for feedback, information gain and failure that we can apply directly to the way we deliver software.</div>
  <div class="bio">Chris Conley is a software engineer lead at Monetate. Prior to Monetate he co-founded an accelerator-backed startup, Houdini and a mobile train app, iSepta.org.</div>

  <div class="pic" ><img alt="Ryan Deering" src="/images/speakers/ryan_deering.jpg"/></div>
  
  <div class="author">Ryan Deering</div>
  <div class="abstract">This talk will focus on how to use NVidia&#8217;s cuRAND and cuBLAS to accelerate Monte Carlo simulations with a GPU in C#.</div>

  <div class="title">Blinker</div>
  
  <div class="pic" ><img alt="Steve Dorazio" src="/images/speakers/steve_dorazio_300x300.jpg"/></div>
  
  <div class="author">Steve Dorazio</div>
  <div class="abstract">The talk will cover the basics of Blinker, along with a few use-cases where blinker was used, and a live demonstration of how simple, yet powerful, Blinker can be.</div>
  <div class="bio">Steve Dorazio graduated from Drexel University with a degree in Software Engineering.  He is currently a Software Developer at 50onRed, where his team specializes in web development in Python using Flask, SQLAlchemy, & numerous other frameworks.

  <div class="title">Lapis - the Web Framework that Runs Inside Nginx</div>
  
  <div class="author">Stefan Natchev</div>
  <div class="abstract">Lapis is a small, yet feature-rich framework for Lua (and Moonscript!). Although obviously inspired by Rails, it stays true to Lua&#8217;s philosophy of being small, simple to understand and composable. Because it relies on Nginx event loop, all actions including HTTP requests and database queries are asynchronous. With the power of Lua coroutines code is written synchronously but runs asynchronously, without all that callback spaghetti seen in other asynchronous platforms. It&#8217;s fast, easy to read, and easy to write.</div>

  <div class="title">Docker for Testing, Shipping, and Deploying</div>
  
  <div class="pic" ><img alt="Eric Windisch" src="/images/speakers/eric_windisch.jpg"/></div>
  
  <div class="author">Eric Windisch</div>
  <div class="abstract">Docker is gaining popularity in testing, shipping, and deploying applications. What is it? How does it compare to Ruby&#8217;s bundler/RVM or Python&#8217;s virtualenv? Eric will introduce you to Docker and will provide answers to these questions.</div>
  <div class="bio">Eric Windisch has been building hosting and compute services automation since 2001, is a long-time contributor to OpenStack, and is currently building a new generation of cloud and container technologies at Docker, Inc.</div>

  <div class="title">Put a REPL on it!</div>
  
  <div class="author">Dan McClory</div>
  <div class="abstract">Read-Eval-Print Loops are invaluable tools, useful for learning, prototyping and debugging. This talk celebrates the simplicity of the REPL by showing how, with a trivial amount of code you can write a REPL to interact with Redis, Python, or just about anything.</div>
  <div class="bio">Dan McClory is a web developer at PromptWorks, working primarily with Ruby and JavaScript. He&#8217;s also a programming languages and paradigms enthusiast. And he really likes REPLs.</div>

  <div class="pic" ><img alt="Ben Plotnick" src="/images/speakers/ben_plotnick.png"/></div>
  
  <div class="author">Ben Plotnick</div>
  <div class="abstract">SaltStack is a powerful python-based configuration management and remote execution tool that allows you to easily control any environment - from two servers to thousands. Salt is scaleable, easy to use, and completely open source. I will walk through the main features of salt, how it compares to other tools, and why you will want to immediately start adding a little bit of salt to everything.</div>
  <div class="bio">Ben is a systems engineer at Susquehanna International Group - a global quantitative trading firm located in Bala Cynwyd, PA - working primarily on high performance computing and trading platform optimization.  Prior to that he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with BSE and MSE in Electrical Engineering.</div>

  <div class="title">Torquebox - Like a JBoss</div>
  
  <div class="author">Joe Winter</div>
  <div class="abstract">Torquebox is an application server that can run your Rails, Sinatra, or Rack-based app inside of JBoss. Torquebox gives you all of the caching, clustering, messaging, and background job management tools available from JBoss without having to leave the comfort of Ruby. This talk aims to give a basic overview of Torquebox&#8217;s architecture, how to get it up and running, and some pros and cons on whether it might fit your application.</div>
